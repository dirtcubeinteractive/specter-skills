# Specter Players — auth, profiles, player data, friends

Base URL and headers: see the `specter` skill. Everything here is `POST {base}/...` with
`api-key`; player-scoped (`player/me/*`) endpoints also need `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.

## Signing players in

**Default recommendation for games: custom ID auth** — silent login keyed to your own player
identity (device id or your server's user id). No password UX, and one call handles both first
launch and returning players:

```json
POST /auth/login-custom
{ "customId": "device-or-player-id", "createAccount": true }
→ data: { accessToken, entityToken, user: {...} }
```

`createAccount: true` signs the player up automatically on first login. Full method list:

| Method | Signup | Login |
|---|---|---|
| Custom ID (silent) | `auth/signup-custom` | `auth/login-custom` |
| Email + password | `auth/signup-email` | `auth/login-email` |
| Username + password | `auth/signup-username` | `auth/login-username` |
| Google | `auth/signup-google` | `auth/login-google` |
| Apple | `auth/signup-apple` | `auth/login-apple` |
| Facebook | `auth/signup-facebook` | `auth/login-facebook` |
| Steam | `auth/signup-steam` | `auth/login-steam` |
| Discord | `auth/signup-discord` | `auth/login-discord` |

Password lifecycle: `account/change-password` (Bearer), `account/forgot-password` → emailed
link → `account/reset-password`.

Token lifecycle: access tokens expire ~1h. Refresh proactively with `auth/refresh-token`
(api-key auth; send `entityToken` + the expiring access token in the body) and check with
`auth/validate-token` (Bearer) on app resume. On 401, refresh once, then re-login.

**Signup is the moment Specter initializes the player** — wallets for every project currency,
default inventory items, and battle pass tiers are created by a background queue right after
signup. This takes a moment; don't assume wallets/inventory exist in the same frame as the
signup response.

## Account linking (avoid lost progress)

Players who start anonymously (custom ID) should be able to attach a recoverable login later:

- `account/link` (Bearer) — attach email/social credentials to the current account
- `account/unlink` (Bearer) — detach a method

One Specter account ↔ many auth methods. Always offer linking before players switch devices.

## Profiles & custom player data

| Endpoint | Auth | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `player/me/get-profile` | Bearer | Authenticated player's full profile |
| `player/me/update-data` | Bearer | Write custom key/value player data |
| `player/me/get-data` | Bearer | Read custom data |
| `player/me/remove-data` | Bearer | Delete custom data keys |
| `player/me/upload-icon` | Bearer | Avatar upload |
| `player/get-profile` | Bearer | Another player's public profile (profile screens) |
| `player/update-data`, `player/remove-data` | Bearer | Mutate another player's data — **trusted contexts only**, never an untrusted client flow |
| `app/get-players` | api-key | Bulk player lookup |

Custom data is schemaless key/value per player — good for game settings, save-state pointers,
flags. It is **not** the inventory/wallet system; use specter-economy for owned things.

## Friends

Request flow: `friends/send-request` → recipient `friends/accept-request` /
`friends/decline-request`; sender can `friends/cancel-request`; either side `friends/remove`.

Reads: `player/me/get-friends`, `player/me/get-pending-friend-requests`,
`player/me/get-sent-friend-requests`; `player/get-friends` (api-key) for other players.

## Product manual (concepts & terminology)

The Specter **user manual** (the same docs game designers read in the dashboard) is bundled in
[references/manual-index.md](references/manual-index.md) — read it to understand the CONCEPTS and
intent behind this domain (what each type/feature means, how dashboard workflows map to the API),
then pair it with the endpoint references for exact request shapes.


## Client (v2) API — what you call FROM your game

The **game-side** endpoints (all `POST /v2/client/*`, authed with the project api-key + a player
access token for player-scoped calls) are indexed with full request DTOs + auth in
[references/client-api-index.md](references/client-api-index.md). Use these for code that ships in
the game/app. **Never call the `/v1/*` admin API from game code** — that's dashboard-only.
